<h2>Technology</h2>
<body>  <p>Once upon a time; Earth was a lucious planet covered in greenery. 
This changed once man became an industrial giant. 
Many forests, rainforests, and otherwise lush areas were destroyed to make way for technology.</p>

<h1>The Industrial Revolution</h1> 
<p>The industrial revolution became worldwide almost overnight. 
As soon as people discovered easy and efficient labor; Earth was doomed.
Humans have been neglecting the Earth for centuries, but recently, things have began to snowball into an almost unstoppable epidemic.
While I am very thankful to have access to technology, I am burdened by the thoughts of Earth slowly dying.</p>

    <h2>When will the carnage end?</h2>
    <p>Since the quality of life for many creatures is becoming poor: humans must put Earth back on the path to recovery.
There are many ways to rejuvinate the planet, but it would cost companies a large amount.
Those who own businesses that contribute to the deterioration of Earth should face serious penalties, but don't because of "reputation."

<h2>Plant and Animal Life</h2>
<p>Plant life has become increasingly sparse, along with many animal species. 
    There are numerous animal species that have gone extinct due to over-hunting, trapping, and illegal trade.
    Almost every business on Earth profits from deforestation, and expanding cities.

<h3>In Conclusion</h3>
<p>While Earth is slowly dying, it is fighting back. 
    The ice caps are melting, which will flood the entire planet. The temperature is steadily increasing, which will keep getting worse.
    There are many new diseases which are become an immense threat.
    If we continue down the path of neglect, Earth will die, along with everybody on it.</p>
