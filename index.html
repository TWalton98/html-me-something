<title>A story about climate change.</title>

<h2>Technology</h2>
<body>  <p>     Once upon a time; Earth was a lucious planet covered in greenery. 
This changed once man became an industrial giant. 
Many forests, rainforests, and otherwise lush areas were destroyed to make way for technology.</p>

<h1>The Industrial Revolution</h1> 
<p>     The industrial revolution became worldwide almost overnight. 
As soon as people discovered easy and efficient labor; Earth was doomed.
Humans have been neglecting the Earth for centuries, but recently, things have began to snowball into an almost unstoppable epidemic.
While I am very thankful to have access to technology, I am burdened by the thoughts of the resources required to provide us with said technology.   
Almost every business on Earth profits from deforestation, and expanding cities. 
Those who own businesses that contribute to the deterioration of Earth should face serious penalties, but don't.</p>

    <h2>When will it end?</h2>
    <p>     Since the quality of life for many creatures is becoming poor: humans must put Earth back on the path to recovery.
There are many ways to rejuvinate the planet, but it would cost companies a large amount. 
The ice caps are melting, which will flood the entire planet.
If we continue down the path of neglect, Earth will die.

<h2>Plant and Animal Life</h2>
<p>     Plant life has become increasingly sparse, along with many animal species. 
    There are numerous animal species that have gone extinct due to over-hunting, trapping, and illegal trade.
    Animals are being forced closer to the populous, which is putting the animals and the humans that live there in danger.

<h3>In Conclusion</h3>
<p>   We must change our ways, or we will empty Earth of its resources.
