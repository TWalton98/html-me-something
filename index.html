<body>  <p>Once upon a time; Earth was a lucious planet covered in greenery.

<h1>The Industrial Revolution</h1> 
<p>The industrial revolution became worldwide almost overnight. 
As soon as people discovered easy and efficient labor; Earth was doomed.
Humans have been neglecting the Earth for centuries, but recently, things have began to snowball into an almost unstoppable epidemic.
While I am very thankful to have access to technology, I am burdened by the thoughts of Earth slowly dying.</p>

    <h2>When will the carnage end?</h2>
    <p>Since the quality of life for many creatures is becoming poor: humans must put Earth back on the path to recovery.

Those who own businesses that contribute to the deterioration of Earth should face serious penalties, but don't because of "reputation."
